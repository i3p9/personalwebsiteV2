summary: "Introduction blog to getting started with GraphQL and Blogging"

Hello everyone! Who am I kidding, I'm going to be the only person reading this thing, aren't I?

*Why this blog?*

Well, my ADHD brain jumps me in and out of stuff quite a bit more than I can handle, and thus I've had a great deal of difficulty with keeping with with old projects, documents I read or simply something that I watched. I started keeping notes, which I prompptly stopped because who wants to painstakingly keep records of interesting things they have came across? Not this guy!

So I've decided I will learn to deal with `GraphQL` and start this blog at the same time. The contents will probably consist of tech stuff, macOS and it's many caveats (and how to get around them). If you've never seen my macOS stuff, do give [https://mac-setup.vercel.app](https://mac-setup.vercel.app) a visit and you'll maybe pick up a thing or two about macOS automation.

In the meantime, I will keep working on the blog UI, work on better codeblocks, tags and whatnot.

Since you're already here, let me share a *cool* thing.

## zsh prompts for human

Anyone using terminal (I hope iTerm2) knows what's a pain in the butt zsh plugins are. You've probably seen some really good prompts but setting them up, managing plugins and getting them to work on multiple machines is a hassle and oh god, the speed, oh my zsh is *so slow*, so check out [zsh4humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans), made by the same person who made Powerlevel10k, it's like everything a regular developer would need without all the bloat.

It comes with Powerlevel10k already, has autocomplete support, syntax `highlighting`, command completions (so great!) and searchable history. The entire config teleports automatically to connections over ssh. And most importantly, it's *very fast*. It also has the fancy git prompts where you can see which branch/commit are you working on, file status and a lot.

That's it for today. Take care.
